Login App README

The app was initially created as of October 26th. 2022.

Installation guides for Mac, Linux and Windows may be found as PDFs in this folder.

The app depends on external libraries. You may install all of these at once using "npm install" from the root folder of the project.

The goal of the app is to provide a easier and quicker way to keep up to date with all of Logins and our colloborative partners events.

The app may not be copied or redistributed in any way without prior formal agreement with Login.
