Login App README

The app was initially created as of October 26th. 2022.

Installation guides for Mac, Linux and Windows may be found as PDFs in this folder.

The app depends upon many external libraries, which may be found in the Login App Dependencies file, or directly in the package.json file.

The goal of the app is to provide a easier and quicker way to keep up to date with all of Logins and our colloborative partners events.

The app may not be copied or redistributed in any way without prior formal agreement.
