Features planned:

    3. Implement mail sending service
        - issue: needs backend
        - vent at tekkom meeting
        - provides:
            - report scheme
            - method to enroll for events through the app

    4. Swipable navigation
        - idea: Needs to be gesture and listener based,
        - not sure how to do swipe logic
        - idea: could render with negative and positive values to create a illusion that a swipe is in progress, and update the swiping as the user goes?

    5. Make bell automatically enroll you for the event clicked (not desired without tweaks in case of accidental clicks)
        - Requires mail sending service to send enrollment via mail

    6. Report feature
        - Ready in app, missing backend

Future features:
    8. Admin tool
        - Provides way to manage things in the app
        - Add job ads through the app
        - Add events through the app

Bug fixes needed:
    1. Bottom navigation menu too low on some deviecs
        -  Unknown how to get it to always be at the bottom due to some devices not having 0 at the actual bottom.
